Introducing asynchronous JavaScript
 - Asynchronous programming: A technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task 
 and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until
 that task is finished.
 - Basically, a technique that allows your program to run multiple tasks at once.
 - With synchronous programming, the browser waits for each line to finish its work before continuing onto 
 the next line.
 - Event handlers are a form of asynchronous programming: you provide a function (the event handler) that
 will be called, not right away, but whenever the event happens.
     • Some early asynchronous APIs used events in this way, such as the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API, which 
     enables you to make the HTTP requests to a remote server using JavaScript. With XHR, you can retrive
     data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.
     • Example of code: const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
 - An event handler is a particular type of callback.
     • callback: a function that's passed into another function, with the exception that the callback will
     be called at the appropriate time.
     • We don't use calllbacks anymore. We use promises.

How to use promises
 - Promises: an object returned by an asynchronous function, which represents the current state of the operation.
 - With promise-based APIs, the asynchronous function starts the operation and returns a Promise object.
     • The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its
     resulting value.
 - A promise can be in one of the following states:
     • pending: initial state, neither fulfulled nor rejected
     • fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
     • rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 - Chaining promises
      • With the fetch() API, once you get a Response object, you need to call another function to get the
      response data.
      • In 'images/chaining-promises', the console prints the first item in the products.json file.
