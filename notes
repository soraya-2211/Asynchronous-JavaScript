Introducing asynchronous JavaScript
 - Asynchronous programming: A technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task 
 and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until
 that task is finished.
 - Basically, a technique that allows your program to run multiple tasks at once.
 - With synchronous programming, the browser waits for each line to finish its work before continuing onto 
 the next line.
 - Event handlers are a form of asynchronous programming: you provide a function (the event handler) that
 will be called, not right away, but whenever the event happens.
